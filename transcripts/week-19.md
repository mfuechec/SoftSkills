# Week 19 - Book Club Discussion

**Date:** March 19, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Topic:** The ambiguous ending - Did Jonas and Gabriel survive? (Giver Final Reflection)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** Now that we've finished The Giver and had time to reflect, let's revisit the ending. Have any of your interpretations changed?

**Jordan:** I've been thinking about it all week. I'm more convinced now that they survived.

**Maya:** What changed your mind, Jordan?

**Jordan:** The specificity of the descriptions. The music, the lights, the warmth. If Lowry wanted us to think he was hallucinating, she'd have made it more dreamlike.

**Casey:** That's interesting. I've actually gone the opposite direction. I think the ending is deliberately unclear because the survival doesn't matter as much as the choice.

**Alex:** I agree with Casey. Whether Jonas lived or died, he chose freedom. That's what the book is really about.

**Sam:** But doesn't it matter emotionally? Like, I want to know if Gabriel got to grow up free.

**Maya:** Sam raises a good point. We're invested in these characters as people, not just symbols.

**Alex:** True. I think we can hold both ideas—intellectually, the ambiguity serves a purpose, but emotionally, we want them to survive.

**Jordan:** Alex, that's really well put. The tension between intellectual understanding and emotional need.

**Casey:** This book has so many layers. Every time we discuss it, I notice something new.

**Sam:** Like what? Give me an example.

**Casey:** Like how Jonas's journey from the community to Elsewhere mirrors humanity's journey from ignorance to knowledge. It's like a coming-of-age for the whole human race.

**Maya:** Casey, that's a profound interpretation. Can you expand on that?

**Casey:** Sure. The community represents childhood—everything is safe and controlled and you don't have to make hard choices. But Jonas chooses to grow up, even though it's painful and dangerous. That's what we all have to do eventually.

**Alex:** And the memories represent history and experience. You can't be a complete person without understanding where you came from.

**Jordan:** Building on that, the community's choice to eliminate memory is like refusing to grow up. Staying children forever.

**Sam:** But children who can kill without knowing it. That's the danger of chosen ignorance.

**Maya:** You're all synthesizing these ideas beautifully. This is sophisticated literary analysis.

**Casey:** What do you think happens next? Like, if we could read a sequel?

**Jordan:** I think Jonas finds a community that's different. Maybe not perfect, but real. With real emotions and real choices.

**Alex:** And maybe he becomes like the Giver was to him. Teaching the next generation about memories and truth.

**Sam:** What about Gabriel? He'd grow up free, never knowing what he escaped from.

**Casey:** That's bittersweet. His freedom was bought with Jonas's sacrifice, but he'll never fully understand what that means.

**Maya:** Sometimes the greatest gifts are the ones we don't even know we received.

**Jordan:** I wonder if Jonas would ever go back to his community. Try to help them adjust to the memories.

**Alex:** I don't think so. Going back would be too dangerous, and the Giver is there to help them. Jonas's role was to break the system, not fix it.

**Casey:** That's true. Sometimes you have to destroy something before you can rebuild it better.

**Sam:** Do you think the community survived getting the memories back? Or did it collapse?

**Maya:** What do you all think?

**Jordan:** I think some people couldn't handle it. There would be chaos at first. But eventually, they'd have to adapt.

**Casey:** The strong emotions would be overwhelming, but humans are resilient. They'd figure it out.

**Alex:** With the Giver's help. He stayed behind specifically to guide them through it.

**Sam:** But he's old and tired. Can one person really help thousands of people process trauma?

**Jordan:** Maybe not perfectly, but he can try. Sometimes trying is enough.

**Maya:** These what-if questions show how deeply you've engaged with the story. You're extending the narrative in your minds.

**Casey:** That's what good books make you do. They don't end when you close them.

**Alex:** They become part of how you think about the world.

**Sam:** This book definitely changed how I think. Like, I question things more now.

**Jordan:** Same. I pay more attention to language and how it's used to manipulate.

**Casey:** And I think more about the cost of comfort. Whether safety is worth giving up freedom.

**Alex:** I think about individual responsibility. What Jonas did alone changed everything.

**Maya:** All of you have taken something different from this book. That's the mark of great literature—it speaks to different people in different ways.

**Teacher:** Let's shift to thinking about our next book. How do you think Brave New World will compare?

**Jordan:** From what we've read so far, it's way more technological. The Giver's community was simple and controlled. Brave New World is complex and controlled.

**Casey:** Yeah, different methods but same goal—preventing people from thinking for themselves.

**Sam:** The Giver's community used rules and sameness. Brave New World uses pleasure and distraction.

**Alex:** Which one is scarier?

**Maya:** That's a great question, Alex. What do you all think?

**Casey:** Brave New World is scarier to me because people think they're happy. In The Giver, Jonas figured it out. In Brave New World, most people can't even conceive of something being wrong.

**Jordan:** Plus, The Giver's community is small and isolated. Brave New World is global. That makes it harder to escape or change.

**Sam:** But at least in Brave New World people get to have fun. In The Giver, everything was boring and restricted.

**Alex:** Is fake fun better than no fun? That's basically the question.

**Maya:** And that ties back to our earlier discussion about the ending. Is fake survival—Jonas hallucinating freedom—better than no survival?

**Jordan:** I'd say no. Reality matters, even when it's hard.

**Casey:** I agree. I'd rather face uncomfortable truth than comfortable lies.

**Sam:** But most people wouldn't choose that. Most people would take the soma or stay in the community.

**Alex:** That's what makes Jonas special. And why his choice matters so much.

**Maya:** Do you think you'd be Jonas in that situation? Or would you stay comfortable?

**Casey:** I want to say I'd be Jonas, but honestly, I don't know. It's easy to say you'd be brave when you're safe.

**Jordan:** I think it depends on whether you had someone like the Giver supporting you. Jonas couldn't have done it alone.

**Sam:** And he had Gabriel to save. Sometimes you find courage for other people that you can't find for yourself.

**Alex:** I think I'd want to be Jonas, but I'd be scared. Really, really scared.

**Maya:** That's honest, Alex. Courage isn't not being scared. It's being scared and acting anyway.

**Jordan:** Which is exactly what Jonas did. He was terrified but he went anyway.

**Casey:** Because staying was no longer an option. Once you know the truth, you can't unknow it.

**Sam:** That's the burden of knowledge. Ignorance is bliss, but knowledge is responsibility.

**Alex:** And Jonas chose responsibility. Even though it cost him everything.

**Maya:** These connections you're making show real moral reasoning. You're not just reading—you're grappling with genuine ethical questions.

**Teacher:** Last few minutes. If you could ask Lois Lowry one question about The Giver, what would it be?

**Jordan:** Did Jonas and Gabriel survive? I know she probably won't answer, but I need to ask.

**Casey:** Why did you choose such an ambiguous ending? What were you trying to make us feel?

**Sam:** Is there a real-world community like this? Something that inspired the book?

**Alex:** What do you hope readers take away from this story?

**Maya:** If you could tell Jonas one thing, what would it be?

**Teacher:** These are all thoughtful questions. They show you understand that books come from authors making deliberate choices to create meaning.

**Jordan:** Do you think Lowry knows how much this book affects people? Like, does she know how much we've talked about it?

**Casey:** She must. The Giver is considered a classic. It's been affecting readers for decades.

**Alex:** That's kind of amazing. She wrote something that keeps mattering to people long after she finished it.

**Sam:** That's what I want to do someday. Create something that matters.

**Maya:** You're all capable of that. This discussion proves you think deeply about important things.

**Jordan:** Can we talk about the movie adaptation? Has anyone seen it?

**Casey:** I saw it. It was okay, but the book is way better.

**Sam:** Movies can never capture internal thoughts the way books can. Jonas's entire journey is internal.

**Alex:** Plus, the ambiguity of the ending doesn't work as well on screen. You need the reader's imagination.

**Maya:** Good point. Some stories are better suited to certain mediums.

**Jordan:** I'm glad we read it instead of watching it. Reading made us engage more deeply.

**Casey:** Agreed. If we'd watched the movie, we wouldn't be having these discussions.

**Teacher:** That's an important observation about active versus passive engagement with stories. Reading requires participation.

**Sam:** This might sound weird, but I'm grateful for this book. Even though it was hard and sad.

**Casey:** Not weird at all. I'm grateful too.

**Alex:** Me too. It taught me things I needed to learn.

**Jordan:** About courage and truth and the cost of freedom.

**Maya:** And about how one person's choices can change everything.

**Casey:** And how love requires action, not just feeling.

**Sam:** And how communities can be built on lies without people even knowing it.

**Alex:** We should pay attention to our own communities. Make sure we're not accepting lies just because they're comfortable.

**Jordan:** That's the real lesson, isn't it? The book isn't about some far-off dystopia. It's about being aware right now.

**Maya:** Exactly. Dystopian fiction is always about the present, not the future.

**Casey:** It's warning us about what could happen if we're not careful.

**Sam:** Or what is happening that we're not noticing.

**Alex:** That's sobering. But important.

**Teacher:** This has been an outstanding discussion. Your growth as readers, thinkers, and discussants has been remarkable. Next week we dive deeper into Brave New World. See you then.

**Maya:** I'm excited to compare the two books more directly.

**Jordan:** Same. I think we'll see a lot of parallels and differences.

**Casey:** And maybe learn even more about our own world in the process.

**Alex:** That's what makes this class valuable. We're not just reading—we're learning how to see.

**Sam:** Well said, Alex. Let's keep that going with the next book.
