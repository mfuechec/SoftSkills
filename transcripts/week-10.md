**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** Alright everyone, let's dive into Chapters 10-12. What stood out to you about Jonas's community and what they've eliminated?

**Maya:** I was really struck by how they eliminated color. Like, that's such a huge sacrifice. They can't see sunsets or, I don't know, the color of someone's eyes.

**Sam:** [interrupts] Yeah but they also got rid of war and hunger, so isn't that worth it? I mean, people were dying before.

**Jordan:** Wait, Sam, let Maya finish. [pauses] Actually, I kind of agree with Sam though. Like, war is worse than not having color.

**Maya:** No, I get that. I'm just saying the cost is bigger than I first thought. They gave up a lot.

**Casey:** I think the community is perfect for what they wanted. They wanted safety, and they got it.

**Sam:** Exactly! That's what I'm saying. They designed it to be safe, and it works.

**Teacher:** Interesting perspectives. Alex, what do you think?

**Alex:** [quietly] I don't know... it seems kind of sad.

**Sam:** But why though? Nobody's suffering. Nobody's starving. That's way better than our world.

**Jordan:** I mean, Sam has a point. But also, they don't get to choose anything. Jonas can't even pick his own job.

**Maya:** That's a really good point, Jordan. The freedom thing is huge. Like, yeah, they're safe, but they're also controlled.

**Casey:** But don't we have rules too? We can't just do whatever we want.

**Sam:** Yeah, but we can choose our careers. We can choose who to marry. They can't.

**Jordan:** [interrupts] Right! And that's—

**Sam:** [continues talking] —and they don't even know what they're missing because they've never experienced it.

**Maya:** Sam, I think Jordan was saying something.

**Jordan:** Oh, uh, yeah. I was just gonna say that's the scary part. They don't even know what they lost.

**Casey:** I guess I never thought about it that way. I was just thinking about the safety aspect.

**Teacher:** So it sounds like we're wrestling with this trade-off between safety and freedom. Do you think Jonas's community made the right choice?

**Sam:** I think they did. War is horrible. My grandpa was in a war and he says it was the worst thing ever.

**Maya:** I see what you mean, Sam. That's a really valid point about war. But I still think... I don't know, I think I'd rather have the choice? Even if it's scary?

**Alex:** [very quietly] Me too.

**Jordan:** Yeah, I'm starting to lean that way too. Like, at first I thought safety was more important, but now I'm not so sure.

**Casey:** This is really hard to decide.

**Sam:** I still think safety wins. But I get why you guys disagree.

**Teacher:** This has been a great discussion. Let's pause here and pick this up next time.
