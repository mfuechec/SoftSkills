**Topic:** Is Jonas's community truly perfect? (Chapters 10-12)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** Alright everyone, let's dive into Chapters 10-12. What stood out to you about Jonas's community and what they've eliminated?

**Maya:** I was really struck by how they eliminated color. Like, that's such a huge sacrifice. They can't see sunsets or, I don't know, the color of someone's eyes.

**Sam:** [interrupts] Yeah but they also got rid of war and hunger, so isn't that worth it? I mean, people were dying before.

**Jordan:** Wait, Sam, let Maya finish. [pauses] Actually, I kind of agree with Sam though. Like, war is worse than not having color.

**Maya:** No, I get that. I'm just saying the cost is bigger than I first thought. They gave up a lot.

**Casey:** I think the community is perfect for what they wanted. They wanted safety, and they got it.

**Sam:** Exactly! That's what I'm saying. They designed it to be safe, and it works.

**Teacher:** Interesting perspectives. Alex, what do you think?

**Alex:** [quietly] I don't know... it seems kind of sad.

**Sam:** But why though? Nobody's suffering. Nobody's starving. That's way better than our world.

**Jordan:** I mean, Sam has a point. But also, they don't get to choose anything. Jonas can't even pick his own job.

**Maya:** That's a really good point, Jordan. The freedom thing is huge. Like, yeah, they're safe, but they're also controlled.

**Casey:** But don't we have rules too? We can't just do whatever we want.

**Sam:** Yeah, but we can choose our careers. We can choose who to marry. They can't.

**Jordan:** [interrupts] Right! And that's—

**Sam:** [continues talking] —and they don't even know what they're missing because they've never experienced it.

**Maya:** Sam, I think Jordan was saying something.

**Jordan:** Oh, uh, yeah. I was just gonna say that's the scary part. They don't even know what they lost.

**Casey:** I guess I never thought about it that way. I was just thinking about the safety aspect.

**Teacher:** So it sounds like we're wrestling with this trade-off between safety and freedom. Do you think Jonas's community made the right choice?

**Sam:** I think they did. War is horrible. My grandpa was in a war and he says it was the worst thing ever.

**Maya:** I see what you mean, Sam. That's a really valid point about war. But I still think... I don't know, I think I'd rather have the choice? Even if it's scary?

**Alex:** [very quietly] Me too.

**Jordan:** Yeah, I'm starting to lean that way too. Like, at first I thought safety was more important, but now I'm not so sure.

**Casey:** This is really hard to decide.

**Sam:** I still think safety wins. But I get why you guys disagree.

**Teacher:** Let's dig deeper. What about the moment when Jonas first sees color? How does that change things?

**Casey:** That part was really powerful. It says on page 94 that he sees the apple change. Like, he can't even name what he's seeing at first.

**Maya:** Good catch with the page reference, Casey. And it's interesting that color is the first thing that breaks through, you know? Not something obviously important, just an apple.

**Jordan:** Maybe that's the point though. Like, even small beautiful things matter. They're not just frivolous.

**Alex:** I liked when he saw Fiona's hair. That seemed really important to him.

**Sam:** Wait, is that supposed to be like him having feelings for her? Because that's another thing they try to control - who you can like.

**Maya:** I think you're onto something, Sam. It's all connected, isn't it? They control emotions, choices, even what you can see.

**Casey:** So if they control everything, what does that mean for Jonas now that he's starting to see differently? Literally and figuratively?

**Jordan:** He's basically becoming an outsider in his own community. That must be so lonely.

**Alex:** [more engaged] Yeah, like he can't even share what he's experiencing with his friends or family. They wouldn't understand.

**Maya:** Alex, that's such an important observation. The isolation is almost a punishment for knowing the truth.

**Sam:** Okay, but wait. Going back to the war and hunger thing - the book mentions on page 102 that they had starvation and climate disasters before Sameness. Isn't preventing that worth some sacrifice?

**Jordan:** Sam's bringing up a good point. What's the actual trade-off here? Like, what exactly did they give up versus what did they gain?

**Maya:** Let's make a list. What did they lose?

**Casey:** Color, music, real love... the ability to choose your job or spouse.

**Alex:** Animals. They don't have real animals anymore, just those weird comfort objects.

**Jordan:** Hills and weather variation. Everything is flat and climate-controlled.

**Sam:** But they gained safety, stability, no war, no hunger, no pain.

**Maya:** So is it a fair trade? I'm hearing different opinions here.

**Casey:** I keep going back and forth. Part of me thinks they should have found a middle ground somehow.

**Jordan:** But can there be a middle ground? Like, either you have choices or you don't. Either you risk war or you control everything to prevent it.

**Sam:** That's what I'm saying! It's all or nothing. They had to go all the way to make it work.

**Alex:** But it doesn't really work though. Jonas's father says on page 98 that they still have to "release" people. That's still... something bad. We just don't know what yet.

**Maya:** Great textual evidence, Alex. So even with all this control, they haven't actually eliminated all problems.

**Casey:** Maybe that's impossible? Maybe you can't create a perfect society no matter what you do?

**Jordan:** Whoa, Casey. That's kind of pessimistic but also maybe realistic?

**Sam:** I don't want to believe that. I think we can make things better than they are now.

**Maya:** Sam, I think both things can be true. We can improve society without it ever being completely perfect. Does that make sense?

**Sam:** [pauses] Yeah, actually. Like, we should keep trying even if we can't fix everything.

**Casey:** That's a better way to think about it. I was being too negative.

**Teacher:** Let's talk about the Receiver role for a moment. What do you make of Jonas being chosen for this position?

**Jordan:** It's interesting that they call it an honor, but from what the Chief Elder says, it's also really isolating and painful.

**Maya:** Right, and Jonas doesn't even get to choose it. It's chosen for him, which kind of proves the point about their lack of freedom.

**Sam:** But they chose him because he has special qualities. The capacity to see beyond, intelligence, courage...

**Alex:** And the capacity to receive pain. That's kind of scary.

**Casey:** What do you guys think the previous Receiver failed at? The one from ten years ago?

**Jordan:** The book doesn't really say, does it? Just that it was a disaster.

**Maya:** That's such a good question, Casey. It makes me worried for Jonas, actually. Like, what if he can't handle it either?

**Sam:** He seems pretty strong though. And he's curious, which helps.

**Alex:** I'd be really scared if I were him. Finding out your whole life is going to be different from everyone else's.

**Maya:** That's really empathetic, Alex. I'd be scared too.

**Jordan:** Do you think Jonas will try to change the community once he has all this knowledge?

**Casey:** I don't know if one person can change an entire system. Even if he's the Receiver.

**Sam:** But someone has to try, right? If not him, then who?

**Jordan:** Building on that, maybe that's what happened to the last Receiver. Maybe she tried to change things and that's why it failed?

**Maya:** Ooh, Jordan, I love that theory. That would make a lot of sense actually.

**Alex:** The rules for the Receiver are really weird. Like, he can ask anyone anything, and he can lie.

**Casey:** The lying one is huge! Everyone else has to tell the truth always.

**Sam:** It's like they're admitting that to do his job, he has to be outside the normal rules. That's kind of contradictory.

**Maya:** Great insight, Sam. The community is built on Sameness and rules, but they need someone who doesn't follow those same rules. That is contradictory.

**Jordan:** Maybe that's another crack in the foundation? Like, if their system was really perfect, they wouldn't need exceptions.

**Teacher:** Excellent observations. Last question before we wrap up - if you were Jonas, would you want this assignment?

**Sam:** Honestly? No. I'd be terrified. But I'd probably do my best anyway.

**Maya:** I think I'd want it because I'm curious, but I'd also be really anxious about it. It's a lot of responsibility.

**Casey:** I'd want to say no, but you can't refuse an assignment, can you? So I'd have to accept it even if I was scared.

**Jordan:** I'd probably feel honored at first and then realize what I was getting into and panic.

**Alex:** I wouldn't want it. Too much pressure. I'd rather just be normal.

**Maya:** Those are all really honest answers. It shows there's no easy answer - it's complicated.

**Teacher:** This has been a fantastic discussion. Great work engaging with the text and with each other. Let's pause here and pick this up next time.
