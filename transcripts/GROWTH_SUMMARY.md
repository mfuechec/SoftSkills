## Key Success Factors

1. **Peer Validation:** Alex's confidence grew through consistent peer validation (especially from Maya)
2. **Self-Awareness:** Sam developed ability to catch and correct himself without external prompting
3. **Peer Support:** Jordan evolved to support others' growth while managing own participation
4. **Gradual Change:** Growth wasn't linear (Sam's Week 20 relapse) but trajectory remained positive
5. **Group Dynamic:** Peer facilitation system developed organically, reducing teacher intervention needs

## Behavioral Milestones

- **Week 12:** Sam's first unprompted apology
- **Week 15:** Alex's prediction validated by peers
- **Week 17:** Jordan proactively prevents interruption
- **Week 19:** Sam achieves zero interruptions
- **Week 20:** Growth sustained in new book context

## Sustainability Indicators

- Sam's immediate self-correction in Week 20 shows internalized skills
- Alex's high participation maintained across context change
- Peer support system robust and functional
- Group transitions to new book while maintaining growth
- Teacher interventions focused on intellectual deepening, not behavior management

## Recommendations for Continued Growth

1. Continue validating Alex's contributions to maintain confidence
2. Reinforce Sam's self-correction when it occurs
3. Support Jordan's peer facilitation role
4. Challenge Casey with increasingly complex analytical tasks
5. Allow Maya to continue evolving as intellectual facilitator
6. Monitor sustainability as context continues to change
