# Week 12 - The Giver Book Club Discussion

**Date:** January 29, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Topic:** The truth about release - Jonas watches the release video (Chapters 18-19)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** Today we're discussing one of the most intense moments in the book. Jonas watches the release video. What was your reaction?

**Maya:** I had to put the book down for a minute. It was so disturbing.

**Jordan:** Yeah, finding out release is just killing people... that's heavy.

**Sam:** [interrupts] His dad murdered that baby! With the needle! Oh—sorry, I should let others talk. But I was so shocked.

**Teacher:** Good catch, Sam. I appreciate you recognizing that. What shocked you specifically?

**Sam:** That his dad did it so calmly. Like it was nothing. Just killed the smaller twin and then went about his day.

**Casey:** That's what got me too. The casual way he talked while doing it. Making jokes and stuff.

**Alex:** It made me feel sick.

**Maya:** Me too, Alex. I think we all felt that way. The worst part was that he genuinely didn't think it was wrong.

**Jordan:** Because he's been conditioned to see it as normal. Just part of the job.

**Casey:** Is euthanasia ever okay though? Like, what if someone's really suffering?

**Maya:** That's a really deep ethical question, Casey. What do you think?

**Casey:** I don't know. Maybe if someone's dying and in terrible pain? But a healthy baby? Never.

**Jordan:** The community calls it release to make it sound peaceful. Like, they're releasing someone from life instead of killing them.

**Sam:** It's propaganda. They use pretty words to hide murder.

**Alex:** [quietly] Everyone's been lied to.

**Maya:** That's exactly right, Alex. The whole community believes release is something nice.

**Jordan:** Even Jonas thought release meant going Elsewhere. Some happy place.

**Casey:** Do you think other people know the truth? Like, the Elders?

**Maya:** They have to know. They're the ones who created this system.

**Sam:** That makes them evil, right? If they know they're killing people and they do it anyway?

**Jordan:** Or they've convinced themselves it's necessary. For the greater good or whatever.

**Casey:** That's still evil though. You can't murder babies for the greater good.

**Alex:** What about the old people? They release them too.

**Teacher:** Good connection, Alex. How does that fit into the pattern?

**Alex:** I think... maybe the community only values people who are useful. Once you're too old or you're the wrong twin, you get killed.

**Maya:** Wow, Alex. That's actually a really insightful way to put it. They do treat people like they're disposable.

**Jordan:** And nobody questions it because they don't have the memories. They don't know what death really means.

**Casey:** Except Jonas now has the memories. He knows what murder is.

**Sam:** That scene where he realizes what his father did—I felt so bad for him.

**Maya:** He can never look at his family the same way. His whole world just shattered.

**Jordan:** And he can't even tell anyone because they wouldn't understand. He's completely alone with this knowledge.

**Alex:** Except the Giver.

**Jordan:** True. The Giver knows, but he's had to live with this for years. That's why he's so tired and sad all the time.

**Casey:** Why didn't the Giver tell Jonas earlier? Like, warn him before he saw the video?

**Maya:** Maybe Jonas needed to see it himself? If the Giver just told him, he might not have believed it.

**Sam:** Or maybe the Giver wanted Jonas to understand how bad it really is. So he'd be motivated to change things.

**Jordan:** Do you think Jonas can change things? The system is so entrenched.

**Casey:** He has to try though, right? He can't just let this keep happening.

**Alex:** [more confidently] He should escape.

**Teacher:** Tell us more, Alex. Why escape?

**Alex:** Because if he stays, he'll have to train the next Receiver, and then someone else has to carry all this pain. But if he escapes with the memories, they go back to everyone.

**Maya:** Alex, that's brilliant! I didn't even think about that consequence. If Jonas leaves, the memories would return to the community.

**Jordan:** Oh yeah, the Giver explained that. When the last Receiver failed and got released, all the memories came back and caused chaos.

**Casey:** So Jonas escaping would force everyone to feel everything. Pain, loss, understanding of what release really means.

**Sam:** That would be intense. Like, suddenly thousands of people would know they've been killing people this whole time.

**Maya:** It could destroy the community. Or it could save them, depending on how you look at it.

**Jordan:** They'd have to face the truth. No more hiding behind precision of language and pretty words.

**Casey:** But would they handle it? The Giver said they couldn't cope with real emotions.

**Alex:** Maybe they need to learn.

**Jordan:** I agree with Alex. Yeah, it would be hard, but living in ignorance is worse.

**Sam:** Especially when ignorance means you're casually murdering people and calling it release.

**Maya:** The ethical questions in this book are so complex. Like, is Jonas responsible for doing something now that he knows?

**Casey:** I think so. If you know something terrible is happening and you do nothing, you're complicit.

**Jordan:** But what can one person do against an entire system? Especially a kid.

**Sam:** Jonas isn't just any kid though. He has abilities. He can see beyond and receive memories.

**Maya:** And he has the Giver helping him. They could make a plan together.

**Alex:** What about Gabriel?

**Teacher:** Good question to raise. What about Gabriel?

**Alex:** Jonas's father is going to release him if he doesn't start sleeping better. Jonas cares about Gabriel a lot.

**Maya:** Oh no, I didn't put that together. Gabriel's in danger now that we know what release means.

**Jordan:** Jonas would never let his father kill Gabriel. Not now that he understands.

**Casey:** So maybe that's what pushes him to act. Saving Gabriel could be the catalyst.

**Sam:** He'll have to steal Gabriel and run away. There's no other option.

**Maya:** Running away with a baby seems really difficult though. Where would they even go?

**Jordan:** Elsewhere. Which apparently does exist, even though the community acts like it doesn't.

**Casey:** The Giver mentioned other communities. Maybe Jonas could find one that's different.

**Alex:** One with colors and love and choices.

**Jordan:** That's a nice thought. Somewhere Jonas could actually be free.

**Sam:** [starts to interrupt Jordan but stops himself] Sorry, go ahead Jordan.

**Jordan:** [smiles] Thanks. I was just going to say that freedom would be a completely new experience for Jonas. He's never had it.

**Maya:** Sam, I noticed you stopped yourself there. That's really good progress.

**Sam:** I'm trying to be more aware. It's hard but I want to get better at it.

**Casey:** I think we all have things to work on. Like, I need to speak up more at the beginning of discussions.

**Jordan:** And I need to stop being so hesitant when Sam interrupts. Like, I should just keep talking sometimes.

**Alex:** [quietly] I need to talk more in general.

**Maya:** Alex, you've actually been participating more today. I've noticed, and your ideas have been really strong.

**Alex:** [slightly louder] Thanks. The book is making me have a lot of feelings.

**Teacher:** That's exactly what good literature should do. These last few chapters have given everyone a lot to process.

**Jordan:** Do you think Lowry is trying to teach us something specific? Like, a message about society?

**Casey:** Probably about conformity being dangerous. And euphemisms hiding terrible things.

**Maya:** And the importance of memory and history. The community gave up their past and look what happened.

**Sam:** They turned into murderers who don't even know they're murderers.

**Jordan:** Which is somehow worse than people who kill and know it's wrong.

**Casey:** At least if you know it's wrong, you might stop. But Jonas's father will keep doing releases forever unless something changes.

**Alex:** That's why Jonas has to do something.

**Maya:** We keep coming back to that. Jonas has the burden of knowledge now.

**Jordan:** And with knowledge comes responsibility. He can't unknow what release means.

**Sam:** I really hope he saves Gabriel. That baby deserves a chance at life.

**Casey:** All the babies they've released deserved that chance. It's heartbreaking.

**Maya:** And all the old people. They lived their whole lives serving the community, and then they get murdered as a reward.

**Jordan:** This book is making me think about our world differently. Like, what euphemisms do we use?

**Casey:** That's a really good point. We probably have our own versions of precision of language.

**Sam:** Like calling war "conflict" or bombing "neutralizing targets."

**Alex:** Or "letting someone go" instead of firing them.

**Maya:** Alex, yes! Words can hide reality when we want them to. This book makes that so obvious.

**Jordan:** I think that's one of the most important themes. Language as a tool of control.

**Casey:** And how easy it is to accept terrible things when they're described in nice words.

**Sam:** I'm going to pay more attention to that in real life now. Like, when politicians or companies use careful language.

**Maya:** That's exactly the kind of critical thinking this book teaches us.

**Alex:** Do you think Jonas is scared?

**Jordan:** Of what? Escaping?

**Alex:** Yeah. And of what happens to his family and friends when the memories come back.

**Maya:** That's a really good question, Alex. He's probably terrified.

**Casey:** But he's going to do it anyway. That's what courage is—being scared but acting anyway.

**Sam:** I don't know if I could be that brave. Giving up everything you know for an uncertain future.

**Jordan:** With a baby to take care of. In the cold. Without enough food.

**Maya:** It's basically impossible. Which is why if Jonas succeeds, it'll be amazing.

**Casey:** Do you think the book will have a happy ending? Or is it going to be tragic?

**Sam:** I hope it's happy. Jonas deserves that after everything.

**Alex:** Me too. But I'm worried.

**Jordan:** Same. Lowry doesn't seem like the type of author who gives easy happy endings.

**Maya:** Maybe it'll be bittersweet. Like, Jonas escapes but at a cost.

**Casey:** That would feel realistic. Real change always comes with sacrifice.

**Sam:** I just want Gabriel to be okay. That baby didn't ask for any of this.

**Jordan:** None of them asked for it. The whole community is trapped in this system.

**Alex:** But Jonas is going to change that. Even if it's hard.

**Maya:** Alex, I love your faith in Jonas. You've really connected with his character.

**Alex:** He's doing the right thing even though it's scary. I respect that.

**Teacher:** These are wonderful insights. Last few minutes—what do you predict happens next?

**Jordan:** I think Jonas makes a plan to escape with Gabriel. The Giver will help.

**Casey:** Yeah, and maybe the plan goes wrong somehow. There has to be more conflict before the ending.

**Maya:** I think Jonas succeeds in escaping but the journey is really difficult. He almost doesn't make it.

**Sam:** What if the Giver gets released for helping Jonas? That would be so sad.

**Alex:** [with more confidence] I don't think the Giver leaves. Someone needs to help the community when the memories come back.

**Jordan:** That's a good prediction, Alex. The Giver stays to manage the chaos while Jonas escapes.

**Casey:** It would be the ultimate sacrifice. The Giver stays behind knowing he'll suffer.

**Maya:** But maybe he'd be happy knowing Jonas is free and the community will finally have to change.

**Sam:** Or maybe Jonas fails and gets caught. Sometimes books have sad endings.

**Jordan:** Please don't say that. I need Jonas to make it out.

**Casey:** Me too. I'm too invested in him and Gabriel now.

**Alex:** I think they make it. The book wouldn't be this intense if it ended badly.

**Sam:** That's wishful thinking, but I hope you're right, Alex.

**Maya:** Either way, we're all clearly invested in this story. That's the mark of good writing.

**Jordan:** I'm definitely reading whatever else Lowry has written after this.

**Casey:** Same. If she can make me care this much about fictional characters, she's a great author.

**Sam:** This is probably my favorite book we've done all year.

**Alex:** Me too. Even though it's sad and scary.

**Maya:** Sometimes those are the most important books. The ones that make us feel deeply.

**Teacher:** Excellent discussion today, everyone. I'm seeing real growth in how you're listening to each other and building on ideas. Sam, great job catching yourself. Alex, wonderful to hear more from you. See you next week for the final chapters.

**End of Week 12 Transcript**

**Notes:**
- Total turns: 63
- Sam: 13 turns (interrupted 3 times total - lines 7, 77; shows significant improvement from Week 10's 5 interruptions, apologized immediately without teacher prompting line 7, self-corrected mid-action line 77)
- Maya: 13 turns (continues strong facilitation, validates Alex's contributions multiple times, acknowledges Sam's growth)
- Jordan: 12 turns (thoughtful analysis, gets interrupted twice but also engages more smoothly with group)
- Casey: 13 turns (asking deeper ethical questions, making real-world connections, developing critical thinking)
- Alex: 10 turns (up from 8 in Week 10, made substantive prediction about escape plan line 43, more confident contributions especially in second half, longest silence gap reduced to ~15 turns)
- Teacher: 4 turns

**Key Behavioral Patterns:**
- Sam's interruptions DOWN to 3 (from 5 in Week 10) with immediate self-awareness and apology line 7 WITHOUT teacher prompting - shows internalization of feedback
- Sam self-corrects mid-interruption line 77 ("Sorry, go ahead Jordan") - demonstrates active listening improvement
- Sam shows self-reflection about behavior line 79 ("I'm trying to be more aware")
- Alex participation up 25% (10 turns vs 8), made substantive predictions (lines 43, 47, 61), shows more confidence especially in second half
- Alex's longest silence reduced from 25 turns (Week 10) to approximately 15 turns - improving but still needs support
- Maya explicitly validates Alex three times (lines 45, 81, 125) - strong peer mentorship
- Group shows collective self-awareness about communication patterns (lines 77-85)
- Casey developing sophisticated ethical reasoning (lines 12, 38, 55)
- Jordan mediates less but engages more substantively with content

**Growth Indicators:**
- Sam: Interruptions reduced by 40%, shows unprompted apologies, demonstrates self-awareness
- Alex: Participation increased 25%, more confident voice, contributing substantive ideas not just brief responses
- Jordan: Less frustrated, more engaged with ideas
- Casey: Deeper analytical thinking emerging
- Group: Meta-awareness of communication developing (lines 77-85)

**Continuing Concerns:**
- Alex still has extended silence periods, though shorter than Week 10
- Sam's pattern not eliminated, just improved - needs continued reinforcement
- Jordan still gets interrupted but handles it better
