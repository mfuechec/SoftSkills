# Week 12 - The Giver Book Club Discussion

**Date:** January 29, 2025
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Topic:** The concept of "Sameness" and memories (Chapters 13-15)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** Today let's talk about the concept of "Sameness" and what it means that Jonas is now receiving memories. How does that change things?

**Sam:** I think it's crazy that one person has to hold all the painful memories. Like, that's so much for one person to deal with.

**Jordan:** Building on what Sam said, it's also kind of unfair? Like, everyone else gets to be happy and clueless while the Giver suffers.

**Maya:** Yeah, and now Jonas too. That scene with the warfare memory was really intense.

**Casey:** I didn't really get why they needed someone to have the memories at all. Why not just forget everything?

**Sam:** [interrupts] Because someone needs to have wisdom! That's the whole point.

**Maya:** Casey, that's actually a really interesting question. I think... maybe it's because they need someone who understands the past to advise them? But you're right, it's not totally clear.

**Casey:** Oh, okay. That makes sense.

**Alex:** The war memory was scary.

**Jordan:** It really was, Alex. That was probably the most disturbing part of the book so far.

**Maya:** I thought it was interesting how Jonas starts to see that Sameness took away more than just pain. Like, they lost beauty and love too.

**Sam:** But they also lost suffering. I keep coming back to that. Isn't it worth it?

**Jordan:** Sam, I hear you, but... I'm starting to think maybe not? Like, Jonas's dad is about to "release" a baby and doesn't even understand what that means. That's kind of messed up.

**Casey:** Wait, what do you think "release" means? I thought they just sent people Elsewhere.

**Sam:** Yeah, that's what I thought too.

**Maya:** Hmm, I'm not sure it's that simple. The way the book describes it feels ominous. I think something bad might happen.

**Jordan:** Oh man, I didn't think about that. Maya, you might be right. That's actually really dark.

**Alex:** [quietly] I think they... I think they might hurt them.

**Sam:** No way. That would be too dark for this book.

**Maya:** Alex, I was thinking the same thing. The clues are pointing that way, aren't they?

**Alex:** [a bit more confident] Yeah, like, why would they make such a big deal about it?

**Teacher:** These are great observations. Let's keep reading with that question in mind.

**Casey:** This book is getting more complicated than I expected.

**Jordan:** Right? At first it seemed straightforward, but now there's so much to think about.

**Sam:** [interrupts] I still think the community had good intentions though, even if—

**Jordan:** [gently] Sorry Sam, I wasn't done. I was going to say that's what makes it interesting - it's not black and white.

**Sam:** Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

**Jordan:** No, that's okay. I think we're basically saying the same thing anyway.

**Maya:** I really like what you said, Jordan, about it not being black and white. That's exactly it. The community isn't evil, but they're not perfect either.

**Teacher:** Great discussion today, everyone. Let's end there.
