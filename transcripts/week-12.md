# Week 12 - The Giver Book Club Discussion

**Date:** January 29, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Topic:** The concept of "Sameness" and memories (Chapters 13-15)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** Today let's talk about the concept of "Sameness" and what it means that Jonas is now receiving memories. How does that change things?

**Sam:** I think it's crazy that one person has to hold all the painful memories. Like, that's so much for one person to deal with.

**Jordan:** Building on what Sam said, it's also kind of unfair? Like, everyone else gets to be happy and clueless while the Giver suffers.

**Maya:** Yeah, and now Jonas too. That scene with the warfare memory was really intense.

**Casey:** I didn't really get why they needed someone to have the memories at all. Why not just forget everything?

**Sam:** [interrupts] Because someone needs to have wisdom! That's the whole point.

**Maya:** Casey, that's actually a really interesting question. I think... maybe it's because they need someone who understands the past to advise them? But you're right, it's not totally clear.

**Casey:** Oh, okay. That makes sense.

**Alex:** The war memory was scary.

**Jordan:** It really was, Alex. That was probably the most disturbing part of the book so far.

**Maya:** I thought it was interesting how Jonas starts to see that Sameness took away more than just pain. Like, they lost beauty and love too.

**Sam:** But they also lost suffering. I keep coming back to that. Isn't it worth it?

**Jordan:** Sam, I hear you, but... I'm starting to think maybe not? Like, Jonas's dad is about to "release" a baby and doesn't even understand what that means. That's kind of messed up.

**Casey:** Wait, what do you think "release" means? I thought they just sent people Elsewhere.

**Sam:** Yeah, that's what I thought too.

**Maya:** Hmm, I'm not sure it's that simple. The way the book describes it feels ominous. I think something bad might happen.

**Jordan:** Oh man, I didn't think about that. Maya, you might be right. That's actually really dark.

**Alex:** [quietly] I think they... I think they might hurt them.

**Sam:** No way. That would be too dark for this book.

**Maya:** Alex, I was thinking the same thing. The clues are pointing that way, aren't they?

**Alex:** [a bit more confident] Yeah, like, why would they make such a big deal about it?

**Teacher:** These are great observations. Let's keep reading with that question in mind.

**Casey:** This book is getting more complicated than I expected.

**Jordan:** Right? At first it seemed straightforward, but now there's so much to think about.

**Sam:** [interrupts] I still think the community had good intentions though, even if—

**Jordan:** [gently] Sorry Sam, I wasn't done. I was going to say that's what makes it interesting - it's not black and white.

**Sam:** Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

**Jordan:** No, that's okay. I think we're basically saying the same thing anyway.

**Maya:** I really like what you said, Jordan, about it not being black and white. That's exactly it. The community isn't evil, but they're not perfect either.

**Teacher:** Let's talk more about the specific memories Jonas receives. Which ones stood out to you most?

**Alex:** The sunshine one was nice. But then the sunburn one right after was painful.

**Jordan:** That contrast is intentional, right? Like, you can't have one without the risk of the other.

**Maya:** Exactly, Jordan. The Giver even says something about that - about how pleasure and pain are connected.

**Casey:** What about the elephant memory? That one was interesting because it wasn't about Jonas at all, it was about the elephant's feelings.

**Sam:** Wait, can animals have feelings in these memories even though they don't in real life in the community?

**Jordan:** That's a really good question, Sam. I think the memories show the world as it used to be, when animals were real and had emotions.

**Alex:** It makes me sad that they don't have real animals anymore. Just the comfort objects.

**Maya:** Alex, I felt the same way. There's something really lonely about a world without animals.

**Casey:** Do you think the community made the right choice about animals? Like, why did they get rid of them?

**Sam:** Probably because animals are unpredictable. They can hurt you or die or make you sad.

**Jordan:** So it goes back to control again. Animals can't be controlled perfectly, so they eliminated them.

**Maya:** That's a great connection, Jordan. Everything comes back to that theme of control versus freedom.

**Alex:** I wouldn't want to live without animals. Even if they can be dangerous sometimes.

**Casey:** Same. My dog is annoying sometimes but I still love him.

**Sam:** [laughs] Yeah, my cat scratches me all the time but I'd be really sad without her.

**Jordan:** See, that's what the community doesn't get. The annoying parts and the good parts are all mixed together. You can't separate them.

**Maya:** Jordan, that's such a mature insight. The messy parts of life are part of what makes it real.

**Teacher:** Let's shift to the war memory. That's the most intense one Jonas has received so far. What did you think?

**Casey:** I had to read that part twice because it was so disturbing. The description of the boy asking for water...

**Jordan:** Yeah, that was brutal. And Jonas is only twelve, experiencing something that traumatic.

**Sam:** It made me understand why the community wanted to prevent war. Like, I get it now, even though I still don't agree with their methods.

**Maya:** Sam, I really appreciate you being open to seeing their perspective even while disagreeing. That's important.

**Alex:** The Giver says the memories have to be held by someone. But why? Why can't they just forget?

**Casey:** The book says on page 111 that they need the wisdom from the memories. But honestly, I'm still not totally clear on how that works.

**Jordan:** Maybe it's like... they need someone who understands history so they don't repeat mistakes?

**Maya:** That makes sense, Jordan. Like, the Receiver advises the Committee of Elders on important decisions.

**Sam:** But they don't listen to him very often. It says he's only consulted rarely.

**Alex:** So one person has to suffer with all these terrible memories just in case they might need advice occasionally? That doesn't seem fair.

**Jordan:** Alex makes a good point. The system uses the Receiver but doesn't really value him.

**Casey:** It's like how they say they honor diversity with different assignments, but really everyone is the same. They say they honor the Receiver, but really they're isolating him.

**Maya:** Casey, that's brilliant. The community says one thing but does another. There's a gap between their ideals and reality.

**Sam:** So they're hypocrites?

**Jordan:** I don't know if hypocrites is the right word. More like... they don't see the contradiction? They really believe they're doing the right thing.

**Maya:** Both of you have a point. There's hypocrisy in the system, but individuals like Jonas's parents aren't trying to be hypocritical. They just don't know any better.

**Alex:** That makes it sadder somehow. If they were evil, you could just hate them. But they're not.

**Casey:** Alex, that's really profound. It's harder when good people create a bad system without meaning to.

**Teacher:** Excellent discussion. Let's talk about Jonas's relationships now. How is his friendship with Asher and Fiona changing?

**Jordan:** He's pulling away from them because he can't share what he's experiencing. It's really isolating.

**Maya:** And he's starting to see them differently. Like, he loves them but also sees how limited their understanding is.

**Sam:** That would be so hard. Like, your best friends are right there but you can't really talk to them anymore.

**Casey:** It's like when you learn something big and life-changing, but the people around you don't get it. You end up feeling alone even in a crowd.

**Alex:** Has anyone else felt like that? Not about something this big, but just... knowing something others don't?

**Sam:** Yeah, like when my parents got divorced, I couldn't really talk about it with friends who had normal families. They tried to understand but they just couldn't.

**Maya:** Thanks for sharing that, Sam. That's really vulnerable. And it's a perfect parallel to what Jonas is going through.

**Jordan:** I felt like that when we moved from another state. Everyone here had all this shared history I wasn't part of.

**Casey:** I think everyone feels like an outsider sometimes. But for Jonas, it's permanent. He can never go back to being like everyone else.

**Alex:** Do you think he wants to? Go back, I mean?

**Jordan:** Good question, Alex. What do you guys think?

**Sam:** I think part of him does. The memories are really painful. But another part of him wouldn't give up what he knows now.

**Maya:** I agree with Sam. It's complicated. He's gaining so much - beauty, love, understanding - but losing so much too.

**Casey:** There's a quote on page 113 where Jonas thinks about how his friends will never know true emotion. That's really sad.

**Jordan:** Building on that, it means Jonas is becoming more human while everyone else is less human. That's kind of the opposite of what you'd expect in this "perfect" society.

**Maya:** Jordan, wow. That's a really sophisticated reading. The community has dehumanized everyone in the name of perfection.

**Alex:** Except Jonas. He's becoming more human.

**Sam:** And the Giver. He's human too, which is maybe why he's so lonely.

**Casey:** So being fully human means being lonely in this society. That's dark.

**Teacher:** These are remarkable insights. Last question - how do you think Jonas's view of his father is changing?

**Maya:** He's starting to see that his father doesn't really understand love. He uses the word, but it doesn't mean anything deep.

**Jordan:** Yeah, when Jonas asks if his parents love him and they say the word is too general, that's pretty devastating.

**Sam:** I mean, they care about him. They're not bad parents. They're just... limited.

**Casey:** But is caring the same as loving? That's what the book is asking.

**Alex:** I don't think so. Love is bigger. It's what Jonas is starting to feel through the memories.

**Maya:** Alex, yes. Love involves risk and pain and depth. The community has eliminated all of that, so they can't really love.

**Jordan:** Jonas's father seems like a really nice guy, but he's going to do something terrible and not even understand why it's wrong. That's scary.

**Sam:** We don't know that yet though. Maybe "release" isn't bad?

**Casey:** Sam, I appreciate your optimism, but I think the signs are pointing toward something dark.

**Sam:** Yeah, you're probably right. I just don't want it to be true.

**Maya:** That's a really honest response, Sam. Sometimes we resist knowing difficult truths.

**Teacher:** This has been an incredibly rich discussion. You're all engaging deeply with complex themes. Great work today.
