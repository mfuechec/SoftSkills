# Week 15 - The Giver Book Club Discussion

**Date:** February 19, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Topic:** The truth about "release" and Jonas's reaction (Chapters 18-19)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** So... we now know what "release" really means. What are your reactions?

**Casey:** I was NOT expecting that. I had to put the book down for a minute.

**Jordan:** Same, Casey. That was really disturbing. And Jonas has to watch his dad do it without even understanding what he's doing.

**Maya:** The worst part for me is that his dad seems like a nice person. He's not evil. He just doesn't know.

**Sam:** I... okay, I was totally wrong before. This is way darker than I thought. Alex called it.

**Alex:** It was really sad. Especially because it was a baby.

**Maya:** Alex, you were right to be suspicious earlier. You picked up on the clues better than the rest of us.

**Alex:** Thanks. I just had a bad feeling about it.

**Jordan:** I think what Maya said about Jonas's dad is really important. Like, he's not a bad person, but he's been so conditioned by the system that he can't see how wrong it is.

**Casey:** That's actually terrifying when you think about it. Like, what if we're all like that about something and don't realize it?

**Sam:** Whoa. That's a really deep question, Casey.

**Maya:** Casey, that's such a good point. It makes you think about our own society and what we might be blind to.

**Jordan:** Yeah, like, are there things we just accept as normal that are actually wrong?

**Alex:** Like... maybe how we treat animals? Or the environment?

**Maya:** Those are great examples, Alex. I hadn't connected it to real life like that, but you're right.

**Sam:** Okay, this book just went from interesting to, like, really important.

**Casey:** So what should Jonas do? Should he leave?

**Jordan:** I don't know. If he leaves, can he actually change anything? Or will the community just keep going the same way?

**Maya:** That's such a hard question. Part of me wants him to stay and try to change things from the inside, but another part thinks the system is too broken.

**Sam:** I think he has to leave. How can he stay after knowing what he knows?

**Alex:** But what about Gabriel? He'll be released soon.

**Jordan:** Oh man, you're right, Alex. Jonas can't just leave Gabriel there.

**Casey:** Wait, so maybe he has to take Gabriel with him?

**Maya:** I love where your head's at, Casey. That would be really brave of Jonas.

**Sam:** But also really dangerous. They're both going to be in trouble if he does that.

**Jordan:** I mean, yeah, but what's the alternative? Let Gabriel die? That's not an option.

**Maya:** I agree with Jordan. Sometimes you have to take risks for what's right, even if it's dangerous.

**Alex:** I hope they both make it.

**Casey:** Me too. I'm actually really worried about how this book is going to end.

**Teacher:** I want to go back to something Casey said earlier about our own society. What are some things we might be blind to?

**Jordan:** That's such a hard question because, by definition, we wouldn't know what we're blind to, right?

**Maya:** That's true, Jordan. But we can try to think critically about what seems normal to us but might be wrong.

**Casey:** I was thinking about how we treat homeless people. Like, we just walk past them like they're invisible. Maybe future people will think that's really cruel.

**Sam:** That's a really good example, Casey. We've kind of normalized ignoring people who need help.

**Alex:** Or how much food we waste when people are hungry. That seems obviously wrong but we do it anyway.

**Jordan:** Building on Alex's point, maybe it's about convenience? Like, Jonas's community sacrifices everything for convenience and safety, and we do that too, just in different ways.

**Maya:** These are all really insightful observations. I think the book is asking us to question what we take for granted.

**Casey:** It's uncomfortable though. Like, it's easier not to think about this stuff.

**Sam:** Yeah, but isn't that the point? Jonas could have stayed comfortable and ignorant, but he chose to see the truth even though it hurt.

**Jordan:** Sam, that's a great connection. So the question is, do we have the courage to see uncomfortable truths?

**Alex:** I want to say yes, but I don't know. It's scary to question everything you thought was normal.

**Maya:** Alex, that's really honest. And I think that's where we all are - somewhere between wanting to know and being afraid to know.

**Teacher:** Let's talk about the Giver's daughter, Rosemary. What do you make of her story?

**Casey:** She couldn't handle the painful memories and asked to be released. But she didn't know that release meant death, right?

**Jordan:** I don't think so. I think she knew something was wrong but not exactly what would happen to her.

**Sam:** The Giver says he loved her and that's why he didn't give her the worst memories. But then she couldn't handle even the medium-bad ones.

**Maya:** That raises an interesting question - was the Giver trying to protect her by withholding the worst memories, or did that actually make her weaker?

**Alex:** Maybe if he'd prepared her better, she could have survived?

**Jordan:** But how do you prepare a child for memories of war and starvation? I don't know if there's a good answer.

**Casey:** I feel really bad for the Giver. He lost someone he loved, and then he had to carry all the memories alone for ten years until Jonas came along.

**Sam:** And now he's worried the same thing will happen to Jonas. That's why he's so careful about which memories to share.

**Maya:** Sam, you're right. The Giver is trying to learn from his mistakes with Rosemary. But that also means Jonas is getting a different training experience.

**Alex:** Do you think Jonas is stronger than Rosemary was?

**Jordan:** That's hard to say. Maybe he's not stronger, just different. He has more anger and determination where she might have had more sensitivity.

**Casey:** The book says on page 142 that when Rosemary was released, her memories went back to the people. That caused chaos. Is that what will happen if Jonas leaves?

**Maya:** Good catch, Casey. That's exactly what the Giver is afraid of. But it's also maybe what needs to happen for the community to change.

**Sam:** So Jonas has to choose between his own safety and changing the community. That's a huge decision for a twelve-year-old.

**Alex:** I don't think he really has a choice though. He can't just ignore what he knows now.

**Jordan:** Alex is right. Once you see the truth, you can't unsee it. Jonas has to act.

**Teacher:** What do you think motivates Jonas more - saving Gabriel or changing the community?

**Maya:** I think it starts with Gabriel. That's more immediate and personal. But it becomes about the bigger picture too.

**Casey:** Yeah, the book shows him realizing that Gabriel's situation isn't unique. Lots of babies and old people are released. It's systemic.

**Jordan:** So he's moving from individual action to systemic change. That's actually really mature character development.

**Sam:** But he's still just a kid. Does he even understand what he's doing? Like, the full consequences?

**Alex:** I don't think anyone could fully understand. He's doing his best with what he knows.

**Maya:** And sometimes you have to act even when you don't have all the answers. That's part of what courage means.

**Casey:** I keep thinking about the people in the community. Like, Jonas's mother and Asher and Fiona. They're going to get all these memories suddenly if Jonas leaves.

**Jordan:** That could be really traumatic for them. They're not prepared at all.

**Sam:** Is it fair for Jonas to make that choice for everyone else? Like, maybe they don't want to know the truth.

**Casey:** But Sam, isn't it better to know the truth even if it hurts? Ignorance isn't really bliss if it means you're harming others without realizing it.

**Sam:** I guess. But I still feel bad for people like Fiona who seem really nice and are going to suffer.

**Maya:** Both Sam and Casey have valid points. This is a situation without easy answers. Someone will suffer either way.

**Alex:** If Jonas doesn't leave, Gabriel dies. That seems like the most important thing.

**Jordan:** I agree with Alex. When there's an innocent life at stake, that has to come first.

**Teacher:** These are complex ethical questions you're wrestling with. Let's talk about Jonas's relationship with the Giver. How has it evolved?

**Maya:** At first, the Giver seemed kind of distant and formal. But now they have this deep bond because they're the only two people who truly understand each other.

**Jordan:** The Giver becomes like a grandfather to Jonas. He's the only adult who treats Jonas as an equal and tells him the truth.

**Casey:** There's that scene where the Giver puts his hand on Jonas's back to share a memory. That physical connection is really important in a community where touch is so regulated.

**Sam:** I didn't think about that, Casey. You're right - they barely touch each other in the community except for the comfort object rituals.

**Alex:** The Giver is giving Jonas something his parents can't - real love and real truth.

**Maya:** Alex, that's beautifully put. And it shows what the community is missing by eliminating deep relationships.

**Jordan:** Do you think the Giver wishes he could escape with Jonas? He could finally be free of the memories.

**Casey:** But he can't, because someone has to help the community when the memories come back. He has to stay.

**Sam:** That's really selfless of him. He's choosing to suffer so he can help others deal with their suffering.

**Maya:** Sam, yes. The Giver is modeling what real love looks like - sacrifice for others' benefit.

**Alex:** I hope Jonas gets to see him again. After everything, they deserve a happy ending.

**Jordan:** I don't know if this book is going to give us a happy ending. It's been pretty realistic about the costs of doing the right thing.

**Casey:** Maybe the point is that doing the right thing isn't about happy endings. It's about making the choice anyway.

**Teacher:** That's a profound note to end on. Finish the book for next time, and we'll discuss Jonas's journey. Wonderful work today, everyone.
