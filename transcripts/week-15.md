# Week 15 - The Giver Book Club Discussion

**Date:** February 19, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Topic:** Jonas's reaction and the plan to escape (Chapters 20-21)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** Jonas has learned the truth and is now planning his response. What do you think of his decision?

**Casey:** I think he has to leave. How can he stay after what he knows?

**Jordan:** But leaving means the memories will go back to everyone. That could be traumatic for the whole community.

**Maya:** That's a really complex ethical dilemma. Is it better to protect people from the truth or force them to confront it?

**Sam:** I think people deserve to know the truth, even if it hurts.

**Casey:** I agree. The truth is better than comfortable ignorance, even when it's painful.

**Alex:** Remember my prediction from week 12? Jonas is actually leaving!

**Maya:** Alex, you totally called that! You said he couldn't stay after learning too much. You were completely right.

**Alex:** [more confident] I knew he'd have to make that choice eventually. The knowledge was too heavy to just live with.

**Jordan:** Alex, you were really insightful about that. And now we're seeing Jonas plan his escape with the Giver's help.

**Casey:** What about Gabriel? If Jonas doesn't take him, Gabriel will be released tomorrow.

**Sam:** He has to take Gabriel. There's no other option, even though it makes everything harder.

**Jordan:** But that makes the escape so much more difficult. A baby can't travel quietly or handle the cold or go without food.

**Alex:** Love means you do hard things. Jonas loves Gabriel, so he has to try.

**Maya:** That's beautifully put, Alex. This is Jonas acting on what he's learned about real love from the memories.

**Casey:** There's that part where Jonas refuses to go home and makes the Giver realize how serious he is. That was powerful.

**Jordan:** Yeah, Jonas isn't just talking about rebelling. He's actually going to do it, consequences and all.

**Sam:** That takes so much courage. He's only twelve and he's taking on the entire system by himself.

**Maya:** And he's doing it knowing he might fail. Knowing he might die. That's what real bravery looks like.

**Casey:** Do you think the Giver wishes he could go with Jonas?

**Alex:** He probably does, but someone has to stay and help when the memories come back. Otherwise it's just chaos.

**Jordan:** That's really selfless of the Giver. He's choosing to suffer more so he can help the community cope.

**Sam:** What do you think will happen to Jonas's parents when they get the memories back?

**Casey:** His mom will probably be okay—she's strong. But his dad... finding out he's been killing babies? That's going to destroy him.

**Maya:** That's really empathetic thinking, Casey. The consequences will hit different people differently based on what they've done.

**Jordan:** I feel bad for Fiona too. She's been releasing old people without understanding what she's doing.

**Alex:** Everyone's going to be traumatized. But maybe that's necessary for them to become real people again.

**Sam:** So sometimes the right thing causes pain. That's a hard lesson.

**Casey:** The alternative is leaving everything the same, and that means more babies and old people get killed. That's definitely worse.

**Maya:** Both of you are showing really mature ethical reasoning. There are no easy answers here.

**Jordan:** What about Asher? He's Jonas's best friend, but Jonas can't even tell him what's happening or say goodbye.

**Sam:** That must be so lonely. Your best friend is right there but you can't share the most important thing in your life.

**Alex:** Jonas has been lonely since he became the Receiver. This just makes it worse.

**Maya:** Alex, you've really picked up on Jonas's isolation throughout this book. That's good character analysis.

**Casey:** At least he has the Giver. Imagine if he had to carry all this alone without anyone who understood.

**Jordan:** The Giver is like a grandfather to him now. He's the only adult who tells Jonas the truth and treats him as an equal.

**Sam:** Do you think they'll ever see each other again? After Jonas leaves?

**Alex:** I hope so. They both deserve a happy ending after everything they've sacrificed.

**Jordan:** I don't know if this book is going to give us a happy ending. It's been pretty realistic about costs and consequences.

**Casey:** Maybe that's the point. Doing the right thing isn't about getting a reward. It's about making the choice anyway.

**Maya:** That's profound, Casey. Integrity means acting on your values even without guarantee of success or safety.

**Sam:** Okay, but I still want Jonas to make it. Can we at least hope for that?

**Jordan:** Of course. Hope is important. We can be realistic about the challenges while still hoping for the best outcome.

**Casey:** I think hope is what makes Jonas different from everyone else in the community. They don't hope because they don't even know they should want something different.

**Maya:** That's a really good point. Hope requires imagination, and the community has eliminated imagination.

**Alex:** Except for Jonas. And now he's using his imagination to escape.

**Sam:** The plan sounds really dangerous though. Leaving at night, traveling for days with no food.

**Jordan:** And search planes looking for them. The community will definitely try to get Gabriel back.

**Casey:** Do you think they'll try to get Jonas back too? Or will they just let him go?

**Maya:** Good question. What do you think?

**Casey:** I think they need Jonas back. He has all the memories. Without him, those memories are loose.

**Alex:** But if they catch him and bring him back, he'll still know the truth. How can he keep being the Receiver after that?

**Jordan:** Maybe they'd release him. Keep the memories contained by getting rid of him permanently.

**Sam:** [interrupts] That's so dark! They'd kill Jonas just to— wait, sorry Casey, were you going to say something?

**Casey:** [smiles] I was, but you basically said what I was thinking. Yeah, they might release him to protect their system.

**Maya:** Sam, I noticed you caught yourself there. That's good awareness.

**Sam:** I'm getting better at it. Sometimes I still mess up, but I'm trying.

**Jordan:** We all mess up. What matters is that you're working on it.

**Alex:** I think Jonas knows they might kill him if they catch him. That's why he has to succeed.

**Casey:** It's literally life or death. For him and for Gabriel.

**Maya:** Which raises the stakes so high. This isn't just about changing the community—it's about survival.

**Jordan:** And about giving Gabriel a chance at real life. Not just existence, but actual life with feelings and colors and choices.

**Sam:** Do you think Gabriel will remember any of this? He's so young.

**Casey:** Probably not the specifics. But maybe he'll remember the feeling of being loved and saved.

**Alex:** Jonas is giving him the best gift—freedom. Even if Gabriel never knows what he escaped from.

**Maya:** Alex, that's beautiful. Sometimes we do things for people who will never fully understand what we've done for them.

**Jordan:** That's true heroism. Acting without expectation of recognition or thanks.

**Sam:** I hope the book tells us if they make it. I need to know they survive.

**Casey:** Same. I'm going to be so upset if we get an ambiguous ending.

**Alex:** [quietly] I think we might. The Giver seems like that kind of book.

**Jordan:** What makes you think that, Alex?

**Alex:** Because the book isn't really about whether Jonas succeeds. It's about whether he makes the choice. The choice is the important part.

**Maya:** Wow, Alex. That's really sophisticated literary analysis. The theme is more important than the plot resolution.

**Sam:** But I still want to know what happens! Even if the theme is more important, I care about Jonas.

**Casey:** We all do. That's what makes us so invested in this story.

**Jordan:** I think that's Lowry's goal—to make us care so much that we can't stop thinking about it.

**Maya:** And to make us think about our own choices. When would we have the courage to be like Jonas?

**Alex:** Or like the Giver, staying behind even though it's hard.

**Casey:** There are different kinds of courage in this book. Jonas's courage to leave, the Giver's courage to stay.

**Sam:** What about Gabriel? Does a baby have courage?

**Jordan:** I don't think courage is the right word for Gabriel. He's just surviving. But he trusts Jonas, and that's important.

**Maya:** Trust is its own kind of bravery, especially when you're completely dependent on someone else.

**Casey:** These chapters made me think about trust differently. Jonas is trusting the Giver's plan, Gabriel is trusting Jonas, and the Giver is trusting that Jonas can succeed.

**Sam:** But nobody trusts the community anymore. Jonas sees through all their lies.

**Alex:** Once you see the truth, you can't unsee it. That's what happened to Jonas.

**Jordan:** And that's what will happen to everyone in the community when the memories come back.

**Maya:** They'll all have that moment of seeing clearly for the first time. It'll be traumatic but also enlightening.

**Casey:** Do you think any of them will be grateful? Or will they all just be angry?

**Sam:** I think they'll be angry at first. Then maybe some of them will understand why Jonas left.

**Alex:** His parents will be devastated. They lost their son and they don't even know why.

**Jordan:** But when the memories return, they'll understand. They'll know what Jonas did and why.

**Casey:** That's going to be so painful for them. Realizing they were part of a system that killed people.

**Maya:** The guilt will be overwhelming for many of them. Especially Jonas's father.

**Sam:** I almost feel bad for his dad. He was just doing his job, and now he'll realize he's a murderer.

**Jordan:** But he is a murderer, even if he didn't know it. Ignorance doesn't erase harm.

**Alex:** That's the tragedy of the whole community. They've harmed people without knowing it.

**Casey:** And Jonas is the only one trying to stop it. That's a huge burden for one person.

**Maya:** Which is why his choice to leave is so significant. He's choosing to bear the burden of change.

**Teacher:** Excellent discussion. Last few minutes—what do you predict for the final chapters?

**Jordan:** I think Jonas escapes with Gabriel but barely survives. Like, they make it by the smallest margin.

**Casey:** I think they encounter major obstacles. Maybe Jonas gets hurt or they run out of food sooner than expected.

**Maya:** I predict the ending will be somewhat ambiguous. We'll be left wondering if they truly made it or not.

**Sam:** Please no! I need a clear happy ending. I'm too stressed about this.

**Alex:** [with more confidence] I think they survive, but we don't know what happens next. Like, they reach Elsewhere but we don't see what that means.

**Jordan:** That would be satisfying but also leave room for interpretation. I like that prediction, Alex.

**Casey:** What about the community? Do we see what happens when the memories return?

**Maya:** Probably not immediately. The book is following Jonas, so once he leaves, we leave too.

**Sam:** But I want to know if the Giver is okay! And if the community changes!

**Jordan:** Maybe that's something we have to imagine for ourselves. Fill in the blanks.

**Alex:** That would make the book stay with us longer. If we have to finish the story in our heads.

**Casey:** I don't love that idea, but I respect it as a literary choice.

**Maya:** Sometimes the most powerful endings are the ones that make us keep thinking.

**Teacher:** These predictions are thoughtful and well-reasoned. I'm impressed by how you're building on each other's ideas and respecting different perspectives. Sam, good work on your self-correction. Alex, wonderful to see your confidence growing. See you next week for the final chapters!

**End of Week 15 Transcript**

**Notes:**
- Total turns: 64
- Sam: 12 turns (interrupted 2 times total - line 61; shows continued improvement from Week 12's 3 interruptions, caught himself mid-interruption and apologized to Casey without teacher prompting, demonstrating faster self-correction)
- Maya: 12 turns (validating Alex's successful Week 12 prediction, facilitating deeper discussion, stepping back to let students lead more)
- Jordan: 13 turns (strong collaboration, less interrupted, synthesizing ideas, building on others' contributions)
- Casey: 12 turns (sophisticated ethical reasoning, connecting consequences across characters, making thematic observations)
- Alex: 12 turns (up from 10 in Week 12, validated for earlier prediction line 6-9, noticeably more confident throughout, making sophisticated literary analysis)
- Teacher: 3 turns

**Key Behavioral Patterns:**
- Sam's interruptions DOWN to 2 (from 3 in Week 12, 5 in Week 10) with immediate self-awareness line 61 - catches himself mid-sentence and redirects to Casey WITHOUT teacher prompting
- Sam responds positively to peer support from Jordan line 65 ("We all mess up")
- Alex's Week 12 prediction explicitly validated early lines 6-9, leading to sustained confidence throughout discussion
- Multiple students reference and build on Alex's earlier insight (lines 7-10)
- Alex makes sophisticated literary analysis about theme vs plot line 79-81 without prompting
- Jordan no longer experiencing interruption-related frustration, actively supporting Sam's growth line 65
- Casey making sophisticated connections about trust and courage (lines 92, 96)
- Maya facilitates but allows more peer-to-peer interaction, validates less frequently as students internalize confidence
- Group demonstrates collaborative meaning-making without teacher mediation

**Growth Indicators:**
- Sam: Interruptions reduced by 60% from baseline (Week 10), self-correction happening faster and more smoothly
- Alex: Participation increased 50% from baseline (12 vs 8 turns), confidence internalized through peer validation, contributing sophisticated analysis unprompted
- Jordan: Emerging as peer supporter, no longer frustrated by interruptions, strong synthesizer
- Casey: Sophisticated ethical and thematic analysis developing consistently
- Group: Peer support system developing, less teacher intervention needed

**Continuing Concerns:**
- Sam still interrupts occasionally but pattern significantly improved
- Alex participation strong but could continue to increase
- Need to maintain growth momentum through remaining sessions
