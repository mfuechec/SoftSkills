# Week 15 - The Giver Book Club Discussion

**Date:** February 19, 2025
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Topic:** The truth about "release" and Jonas's reaction (Chapters 18-19)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** So... we now know what "release" really means. What are your reactions?

**Casey:** I was NOT expecting that. I had to put the book down for a minute.

**Jordan:** Same, Casey. That was really disturbing. And Jonas has to watch his dad do it without even understanding what he's doing.

**Maya:** The worst part for me is that his dad seems like a nice person. He's not evil. He just doesn't know.

**Sam:** I... okay, I was totally wrong before. This is way darker than I thought. Alex called it.

**Alex:** It was really sad. Especially because it was a baby.

**Maya:** Alex, you were right to be suspicious earlier. You picked up on the clues better than the rest of us.

**Alex:** Thanks. I just had a bad feeling about it.

**Jordan:** I think what Maya said about Jonas's dad is really important. Like, he's not a bad person, but he's been so conditioned by the system that he can't see how wrong it is.

**Casey:** That's actually terrifying when you think about it. Like, what if we're all like that about something and don't realize it?

**Sam:** Whoa. That's a really deep question, Casey.

**Maya:** Casey, that's such a good point. It makes you think about our own society and what we might be blind to.

**Jordan:** Yeah, like, are there things we just accept as normal that are actually wrong?

**Alex:** Like... maybe how we treat animals? Or the environment?

**Maya:** Those are great examples, Alex. I hadn't connected it to real life like that, but you're right.

**Sam:** Okay, this book just went from interesting to, like, really important.

**Casey:** So what should Jonas do? Should he leave?

**Jordan:** I don't know. If he leaves, can he actually change anything? Or will the community just keep going the same way?

**Maya:** That's such a hard question. Part of me wants him to stay and try to change things from the inside, but another part thinks the system is too broken.

**Sam:** I think he has to leave. How can he stay after knowing what he knows?

**Alex:** But what about Gabriel? He'll be released soon.

**Jordan:** Oh man, you're right, Alex. Jonas can't just leave Gabriel there.

**Casey:** Wait, so maybe he has to take Gabriel with him?

**Maya:** I love where your head's at, Casey. That would be really brave of Jonas.

**Sam:** But also really dangerous. They're both going to be in trouble if he does that.

**Jordan:** I mean, yeah, but what's the alternative? Let Gabriel die? That's not an option.

**Maya:** I agree with Jordan. Sometimes you have to take risks for what's right, even if it's dangerous.

**Alex:** I hope they both make it.

**Casey:** Me too. I'm actually really worried about how this book is going to end.

**Teacher:** These are incredibly thoughtful connections you're all making. Let's finish the book for next time and see what happens.
