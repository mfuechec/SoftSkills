# Week 17 - The Giver Book Club Discussion

**Date:** March 5, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Topic:** The escape begins (Chapters 22-23)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** We've reached the final chapters where Jonas and Gabriel escape. What did you think of the ending?

**Casey:** It's so ambiguous! I can't tell if they survived or died.

**Jordan:** That's what makes it powerful. We have to decide what we think happened.

**Maya:** What evidence do you each see for survival versus death?

**Sam:** The sled and the lights and music feel real to me. I think they made it.

**Casey:** But Jonas was so weak and cold. Hypothermia can cause hallucinations. He might be imagining what he wants to see.

**Alex:** I think the ambiguity is intentional. Lowry wants us to think about what matters more—whether Jonas survives or whether he chose freedom.

**Jordan:** Hold on Sam, let's hear Alex's full thought. Why do you think that distinction matters?

**Sam:** Oh, I wasn't going to interrupt. But yeah Alex, tell us more.

**Alex:** Well, Jonas made the right choice. He chose freedom and love over safety. Even if he died, he died free instead of living trapped.

**Maya:** That's a really profound way to look at it, Alex. We want good actions to lead to good outcomes, but sometimes the action is enough.

**Casey:** That connects to what we talked about last week. The outcome matters less than the choice itself.

**Jordan:** Casey, good memory. Yeah, the ambiguity might be intentional—the moral choice is what's important, not whether it worked out.

**Sam:** I get that intellectually, but emotionally I still need them to survive. I'm too invested.

**Alex:** Me too. But I think part of growing up is accepting that good choices don't always lead to happy endings.

**Jordan:** That's really mature, Alex. And honestly, kind of depressing but true.

**Casey:** Can we talk about the journey itself? The escape was so intense. When Jonas fell and hurt his ankle, I thought it was over.

**Maya:** Yeah, and when they ran out of food. The survival aspects made it feel so real and desperate.

**Sam:** The part where he couldn't transmit memories to Gabriel anymore because he was too weak—that broke my heart.

**Alex:** He was still trying to comfort Gabriel even though he was suffering too. That shows how much he loves him.

**Maya:** Love as action, not just feeling. That's what Jonas learned from the memories and demonstrates through his choices.

**Jordan:** The cold was described so vividly. I felt like I was freezing just reading it.

**Casey:** And the hunger. Jonas was literally starving, barely able to move, but he kept going for Gabriel.

**Sam:** Do you think Gabriel understood what was happening? Like, did he know Jonas was saving him?

**Alex:** Probably not in a conscious way. But he felt safe with Jonas. That's what mattered.

**Jordan:** And Jonas gave him good memories whenever he could. Even when it drained him completely.

**Maya:** Sacrificial love. Jonas gave up his own comfort, his own energy, his own life potentially, for Gabriel.

**Casey:** That's the opposite of the community's philosophy. They eliminate sacrifice by eliminating real relationships.

**Sam:** So Jonas's love for Gabriel is revolutionary in itself. Not just the escape, but the fact that he cares enough to sacrifice.

**Jordan:** Exactly. The community can't understand that kind of love because they've never experienced it.

**Alex:** When Jonas's memories started coming back naturally—seeing colors, feeling real hunger—that was significant.

**Maya:** Why do you think that's significant, Alex?

**Alex:** Because it shows he's leaving the community's control behind. His senses are waking up. He's becoming fully human.

**Casey:** That's brilliant, Alex. The physical journey parallels his internal transformation.

**Jordan:** And Gabriel starts seeing colors too. Jonas is giving him that gift without even realizing it.

**Sam:** The red sled at the end. Jonas remembered that from his first memory with the Giver.

**Maya:** Good catch, Sam. What does that symbolize?

**Sam:** Maybe it means he found what he was looking for? Or that the memories were real and not just dreams?

**Alex:** Or it's showing us that his first memory and his last moment are connected. Like, his whole journey led to that sled.

**Casey:** If it's real, it means he made it to Elsewhere. If it's a hallucination, it means he died thinking of hope and freedom.

**Jordan:** Either way, it's bittersweet. He escaped the community but at enormous cost.

**Maya:** What do you think happened to the community after Jonas left?

**Casey:** The memories would have gone back to everyone. Suddenly they'd all feel pain, love, loss, color—everything.

**Sam:** That would be completely overwhelming. Most of them have never felt anything intense.

**Alex:** The Giver would have to help them cope. That's why he stayed behind.

**Jordan:** But could he help everyone? There are thousands of people and only one Giver.

**Casey:** Some people probably couldn't handle it. It might destroy them psychologically.

**Maya:** But others might wake up. Might realize what they've been missing and what they've done.

**Alex:** Jonas's father would realize he murdered babies. That knowledge would destroy him.

**Sam:** Fiona would realize she killed old people. All the Caretakers would have that burden.

**Jordan:** And everyone who celebrated releases would know they were celebrating murders.

**Casey:** The guilt would be unimaginable. How do you live with that?

**Maya:** That's the price of truth. Sometimes knowing is more painful than ignorance, but it's also more honest.

**Sam:** Do you think the community would change after that? Like, would they stop releases?

**Alex:** They'd have to. Once you know murder is murder, you can't unknow it.

**Jordan:** But what would they do instead? Their whole system is based on control through release.

**Casey:** They'd have to completely rebuild their society. Create new systems, new values, new ways of dealing with problems.

**Maya:** Which is basically revolution. Jonas didn't just escape—he sparked massive social change.

**Sam:** That's a lot of responsibility for one twelve-year-old kid.

**Alex:** But he didn't do it for power or recognition. He did it because it was right.

**Jordan:** And because Gabriel was going to die if he didn't act. Sometimes one life mattering to you is enough to change everything.

**Casey:** This book made me think about when you have to act versus when you can stay silent.

**Maya:** That's an important question, Casey. What did you conclude?

**Casey:** I think if you have knowledge and ability, you have responsibility. Jonas knew the truth and could act, so he had to.

**Sam:** But that's scary. What if acting makes things worse?

**Jordan:** Staying still was guaranteed to make things worse. At least acting gave a chance for change.

**Alex:** And Jonas didn't act impulsively. He planned with the Giver, he waited for the right moment, he tried to minimize harm.

**Maya:** Good point, Alex. Ethical action requires thought, not just good intentions.

**Casey:** I'm going to remember this book for a long time. It changed how I think about a lot of things.

**Sam:** Same. Like, I'm more aware now of comfortable lies versus uncomfortable truths.

**Jordan:** And how language can hide reality. I notice that everywhere now.

**Alex:** I learned that quiet resistance is still resistance. You don't have to be loud to be brave.

**Maya:** These are all powerful takeaways. This is what literature should do—change how we see the world.

**Teacher:** Before we finish, I want to ask about the title. Why "The Giver" instead of "Jonas" or "The Receiver"?

**Casey:** The Giver is the one who starts everything. He gives Jonas the memories, the plan, the courage to act.

**Jordan:** But Jonas becomes a giver too. He gives the community their memories back, and he gives Gabriel a chance at life.

**Alex:** Maybe anyone can be a giver if they choose to share truth and love instead of hiding it.

**Sam:** So it's not just about one person. It's about what we all should try to be.

**Maya:** That's beautiful. The title becomes about a way of living, not just a character.

**Jordan:** Giving versus taking. Sharing versus hoarding. Honesty versus lies.

**Casey:** The community took from people—took their choices, their memories, their real lives. Jonas and the Giver gave back.

**Alex:** Even though giving cost them everything. That's the sacrifice the title represents.

**Sam:** This might be the best book we've read all year. Maybe ever.

**Casey:** Agreed. I'm going to recommend it to everyone I know.

**Alex:** Me too. Even though it's sad and hard, it's important.

**Jordan:** Books don't have to be happy to be good. This one proves that.

**Maya:** The best books are the ones that stay with you. The ones you keep thinking about.

**Casey:** I'm definitely going to keep thinking about Jonas and Gabriel. Hoping they made it.

**Sam:** I'm choosing to believe they survived. I know it's ambiguous, but I need that hope.

**Alex:** That's valid. The book lets us choose our own ending based on what we need.

**Jordan:** I think they made it too. But barely. Like, by the thinnest possible margin.

**Maya:** Whatever we each believe, we can all agree that Jonas made the right choice.

**Casey:** Absolutely. Escaping was the only ethical option once he knew the truth.

**Sam:** And taking Gabriel was non-negotiable. He couldn't let that baby die.

**Alex:** Love requires action. That's maybe the most important theme in the book.

**Jordan:** Love, truth, freedom, sacrifice—they're all connected. You can't have one without the others.

**Maya:** This has been an incredible discussion. You've all grown so much as readers and thinkers.

**Teacher:** I agree completely. Your analysis has been thoughtful and mature. Next week we'll start Brave New World, another dystopian novel but with a very different approach. See you then.

**Sam:** I'm excited but also sad to move on from The Giver.

**Casey:** Same. This book feels special.

**Alex:** We can still think about it though. It'll stay with us.

**Jordan:** That's the mark of great literature. It doesn't end when you close the book.

**Maya:** Well said, Jordan. Let's carry these lessons forward.

**End of Week 17 Transcript**

**Notes:**
- Total turns: 63
- Sam: 12 turns (interrupted 1 time total - line 13; shows strong improvement from Week 15's 2 interruptions and Week 10's 5 interruptions, demonstrates good listening and waiting)
- Maya: 11 turns (facilitating but letting others lead more, less intervention needed as peer dynamics strengthen)
- Jordan: 13 turns (strong mediator, proactively protects Alex's speaking space line 13, synthesizes ideas effectively)
- Casey: 12 turns (deep critical thinking about morality, sophisticated literary analysis, making thematic connections)
- Alex: 13 turns (consistent with Week 15, makes philosophical observation about ambiguity, fully confident participant)
- Teacher: 3 turns

**Key Behavioral Patterns:**
- Sam shows significant improvement - only 1 interruption (80% reduction from baseline), and even that is unclear as he may have been asking a question (line 13)
- Sam immediately clarifies he wasn't interrupting when Jordan intervenes line 15 - shows heightened awareness
- Jordan proactively mediates by saying "Hold on Sam, let's hear Alex's full thought" BEFORE Sam can potentially interrupt line 13 - peer facilitation at its best
- Alex makes multiple sophisticated contributions without prompting (lines 11, 23, 39, 55, 77)
- Casey demonstrates sophisticated analysis of literary symbolism and themes throughout
- Maya can step back significantly more as students facilitate their own discussion
- Group dynamic shows strong peer support—students building on each other's ideas naturally
- No behavioral corrections needed from teacher—students self-managing discussion flow completely

**Growth Indicators:**
- Sam: Interruptions reduced by 80% from baseline (1 vs 5), shows strong impulse control and awareness
- Alex: Participation maintained at high level (13 turns), confidence fully internalized, contributing sophisticated unprompted analysis
- Jordan: Expert peer facilitator, prevents potential interruptions proactively, strong collaborative skills
- Casey: Sophisticated thematic analysis and ethical reasoning consistently demonstrated
- Maya: Successfully stepped back from constant facilitation role as peer dynamics matured
- Group: Peer-facilitated discussion with minimal teacher intervention needed

**Continuing Concerns:**
- Need to maintain growth in new book/context (transitioning to Brave New World)
- Sam's improvement is strong but sustainability needs monitoring
- Alex's participation could potentially increase even more
