**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** We finished the book! Let's talk about the ending. Did Jonas and Gabriel survive?

**Sam:** I think they did. The ending is hopeful. They found the sled and the lights and everything.

**Casey:** But I'm not sure. It felt kind of ambiguous to me. Like, it could go either way.

**Jordan:** Casey, I was thinking the same thing. Part of me wants to believe they made it, but the cold and hunger were really intense.

**Maya:** What evidence do you each see for your interpretations?

**Sam:** Well, Jonas sees the lights and hears music. That sounds real to me, not like a hallucination.

**Casey:** But couldn't that also be him dying and seeing what he wants to see?

**Alex:** I think they survived. The book would be too sad otherwise.

**Jordan:** Alex, I get that feeling, but I'm not sure the book cares about making us feel better. It's been pretty dark throughout.

**Maya:** These are both really valid interpretations. Jordan, I appreciate you challenging Alex's idea respectfully. And Alex, it's totally okay to hope for a happy ending.

**Alex:** Yeah, I know it might not be realistic. I just want them to be okay.

**Sam:** Honestly, even if they died, they died free. That's better than living in the community.

**Casey:** Hmm. I hadn't thought about it that way, Sam. That actually changes how I see the ending.

**Jordan:** Wait, so Casey, you're saying the ending is hopeful either way?

**Casey:** Yeah! Like, even if it's tragic, it's still about freedom and choice. Which is what the whole book is about.

**Maya:** Casey, that's a really sophisticated reading of the ending. I love that interpretation.

**Sam:** Okay, Casey just blew my mind a little bit.

**Alex:** That makes me feel better about the ending actually.

**Jordan:** Same here. I was feeling kind of depressed about it, but now I see it differently.

**Teacher:** What about the community Jonas left behind? What happens to them?

**Jordan:** That's what I keep wondering. The Giver said the memories would go back to everyone, right?

**Maya:** Right, and that would be really overwhelming for people who've never experienced them before.

**Sam:** Some people might not be able to handle it. It could be chaos.

**Casey:** But maybe that's necessary? Like, maybe they need to go through that chaos to become a real community again?

**Jordan:** Building on Casey's point, maybe chaos is better than the fake peace they had before.

**Alex:** I feel bad for the little kids though. They didn't choose any of this.

**Maya:** That's really empathetic of you, Alex. You're right - the innocent people will suffer too, not just the people who created the system.

**Sam:** But isn't that true of any revolution? Innocent people always get hurt.

**Jordan:** Okay, Sam, I see your point, but I think Maya and Alex are saying we should at least acknowledge that and feel sad about it.

**Sam:** Oh yeah, totally. I wasn't trying to say it doesn't matter.

**Jordan:** I know, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.

**Maya:** I really appreciate how you two worked that out, Jordan and Sam. That was great communication.

**Casey:** This book is going to stick with me for a while.

**Alex:** Me too. I'm going to think about it a lot.

**Teacher:** Let's go back to the journey itself. What were the most significant moments as Jonas and Gabriel traveled?

**Sam:** When Jonas realizes he can't go back. Like, once he steals his father's bike and takes Gabriel, there's no undoing that.

**Maya:** That's such a pivotal moment, Sam. He's burning all his bridges, and he's only twelve years old. That takes immense courage.

**Casey:** The part where he falls off the bike and twists his ankle was really scary. You realize how vulnerable they are.

**Jordan:** And he starts running out of food. The reality of survival hits hard. It's not an adventure, it's a desperate escape.

**Alex:** When he can't transmit memories to Gabriel anymore because he's too weak, that was really sad. He couldn't even comfort him.

**Maya:** Alex, that moment shows how much Jonas has grown. He's trying to use what the Giver taught him to help Gabriel, even though he's suffering too.

**Casey:** There's a line on page 174 where Jonas realizes the community has been searching for him but then stopped. What do you think that means?

**Jordan:** Maybe they gave up? Or maybe they announced he was lost in the river and stopped looking?

**Sam:** Or maybe they did that on purpose, like the Giver suggested, to make it seem like an accident instead of an escape.

**Maya:** That's a good theory, Sam. The Giver might have helped cover for Jonas by creating a false narrative.

**Alex:** Do you think the Giver misses Jonas? He must be so lonely now.

**Casey:** He has to be. Jonas was like a grandson to him. But he chose to help Jonas escape anyway, even though it meant being alone again.

**Jordan:** That's what love is though, right? Letting someone go even when it hurts. The opposite of what the community does.

**Maya:** Jordan, that's beautiful. The Giver models real love by supporting Jonas's freedom, not controlling him.

**Teacher:** What about the memories Jonas loses along the way? The text mentions he can feel them leaving him.

**Casey:** That part confused me. If he's losing the memories, doesn't that mean they're going back to the community?

**Jordan:** I think so. But it happens gradually, so maybe the community is experiencing them slowly instead of all at once like with Rosemary.

**Sam:** That could be better, actually. Like, they're easing into it instead of being overwhelmed.

**Maya:** Sam makes a good point. The gradual release might give people time to process what they're experiencing.

**Alex:** But Jonas is getting weaker without the memories. They were helping him survive, and now he doesn't have them.

**Casey:** So he's sacrificing his own survival for the community's transformation. That's really heroic.

**Jordan:** Or really tragic, depending on how you read the ending. Which brings us back to whether they survive.

**Sam:** Let's look at the evidence again. What makes people think they died?

**Maya:** Well, hypothermia and starvation are real threats. Jonas is exhausted, and Gabriel is just a baby. The odds aren't good.

**Casey:** And Jonas might be hallucinating at the end. When you're dying of exposure, your brain does weird things.

**Alex:** But the sled is real! He saw it in the memory, and then it's actually there. That can't be a coincidence.

**Jordan:** Alex, some people would argue that's Jonas's mind creating what he wants to see. Like, he remembers the sled from the memory, so he hallucinates it.

**Sam:** But the book describes the lights and music really specifically. It feels real, not like a dream.

**Maya:** We're all interpreting the same text differently based on what we want to believe or what evidence we find most convincing. There's no definitive answer.

**Casey:** Which is kind of brilliant, actually. The ambiguity makes us think harder about what matters more - the survival or the meaning.

**Jordan:** Casey, you said something earlier that really stuck with me. About how even if they died, they died free. Can we unpack that more?

**Casey:** Sure. I mean, Jonas could have stayed in the community, been safe, become the next Receiver. But he would have been trapped and miserable.

**Sam:** And Gabriel would have been killed. So Jonas had to choose between false safety and real freedom.

**Alex:** He chose love. He loved Gabriel more than he loved being safe.

**Maya:** Alex, yes. That's the heart of it. Jonas learned what love means through the memories, and then he acted on it.

**Jordan:** So the journey itself is the point, not necessarily the destination. Whether they physically survive, they've already won by choosing freedom and love.

**Casey:** That's a really mature reading of the ending, Jordan. I think you're right.

**Sam:** I still want to believe they made it though. Is that naive?

**Maya:** No, Sam, it's hopeful. And hope is important. We can acknowledge the ambiguity while still hoping for the best outcome.

**Teacher:** Let's talk about the title. Why "The Giver" and not "Jonas" or "The Receiver"?

**Jordan:** That's a great question. I never really thought about that.

**Casey:** Maybe because the Giver is the one who gives Jonas everything - the memories, the plan, the courage to escape.

**Sam:** But Jonas gives too. He gives freedom back to the community by releasing the memories.

**Alex:** And he gives Gabriel a chance at life. He's a giver too.

**Maya:** So maybe everyone can be a giver when they choose love and freedom over safety and control.

**Jordan:** Building on that, maybe the title is saying that giving - of knowledge, love, freedom - is what makes us human.

**Casey:** As opposed to the community, which is all about taking away. They take away choice, emotion, memory, color...

**Sam:** So the title is ironic in a way. The community thinks they're giving people a perfect life, but really they're taking everything meaningful away.

**Maya:** These are all excellent interpretations. The title works on multiple levels, which is a sign of good literature.

**Alex:** I'm going to miss this book. It made me think more than any book I've read before.

**Jordan:** Same. And it's going to change how I see the world. Like, I'll question things more instead of just accepting them.

**Casey:** That's exactly what the book wants us to do. Be like Jonas, not like the community.

**Sam:** Be curious, be brave, be willing to feel pain if it means also feeling joy.

**Maya:** And be willing to sacrifice comfort for what's right. That's the biggest lesson, I think.

**Teacher:** These reflections show real growth in your thinking. Last question - would you recommend this book to others?

**Jordan:** Absolutely. Everyone should read it.

**Casey:** Yes, especially people our age. It's important to think about these questions before we become adults and get set in our ways.

**Sam:** I'd recommend it even though it's sad. Important books don't have to be happy.

**Alex:** I'd tell people it's going to make them uncomfortable, but that's a good thing. Comfort isn't always good.

**Maya:** I agree with everyone. This book should be required reading. It teaches empathy, critical thinking, and courage.

**Teacher:** This has been one of our best discussions. Great work, everyone. I'm proud of how deeply you've engaged with this text.
