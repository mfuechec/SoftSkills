**Date:** March 5, 2025
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Topic:** The ending and Jonas's journey to Elsewhere (Chapters 20-23)
**Participants:** Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam, Casey

---

**Teacher:** We finished the book! Let's talk about the ending. Did Jonas and Gabriel survive?

**Sam:** I think they did. The ending is hopeful. They found the sled and the lights and everything.

**Casey:** But I'm not sure. It felt kind of ambiguous to me. Like, it could go either way.

**Jordan:** Casey, I was thinking the same thing. Part of me wants to believe they made it, but the cold and hunger were really intense.

**Maya:** What evidence do you each see for your interpretations?

**Sam:** Well, Jonas sees the lights and hears music. That sounds real to me, not like a hallucination.

**Casey:** But couldn't that also be him dying and seeing what he wants to see?

**Alex:** I think they survived. The book would be too sad otherwise.

**Jordan:** Alex, I get that feeling, but I'm not sure the book cares about making us feel better. It's been pretty dark throughout.

**Maya:** These are both really valid interpretations. Jordan, I appreciate you challenging Alex's idea respectfully. And Alex, it's totally okay to hope for a happy ending.

**Alex:** Yeah, I know it might not be realistic. I just want them to be okay.

**Sam:** Honestly, even if they died, they died free. That's better than living in the community.

**Casey:** Hmm. I hadn't thought about it that way, Sam. That actually changes how I see the ending.

**Jordan:** Wait, so Casey, you're saying the ending is hopeful either way?

**Casey:** Yeah! Like, even if it's tragic, it's still about freedom and choice. Which is what the whole book is about.

**Maya:** Casey, that's a really sophisticated reading of the ending. I love that interpretation.

**Sam:** Okay, Casey just blew my mind a little bit.

**Alex:** That makes me feel better about the ending actually.

**Jordan:** Same here. I was feeling kind of depressed about it, but now I see it differently.

**Teacher:** What about the community Jonas left behind? What happens to them?

**Jordan:** That's what I keep wondering. The Giver said the memories would go back to everyone, right?

**Maya:** Right, and that would be really overwhelming for people who've never experienced them before.

**Sam:** Some people might not be able to handle it. It could be chaos.

**Casey:** But maybe that's necessary? Like, maybe they need to go through that chaos to become a real community again?

**Jordan:** Building on Casey's point, maybe chaos is better than the fake peace they had before.

**Alex:** I feel bad for the little kids though. They didn't choose any of this.

**Maya:** That's really empathetic of you, Alex. You're right - the innocent people will suffer too, not just the people who created the system.

**Sam:** But isn't that true of any revolution? Innocent people always get hurt.

**Jordan:** Okay, Sam, I see your point, but I think Maya and Alex are saying we should at least acknowledge that and feel sad about it.

**Sam:** Oh yeah, totally. I wasn't trying to say it doesn't matter.

**Jordan:** I know, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.

**Maya:** I really appreciate how you two worked that out, Jordan and Sam. That was great communication.

**Casey:** This book is going to stick with me for a while.

**Alex:** Me too. I'm going to think about it a lot.

**Teacher:** This has been one of our best discussions. Great work, everyone.
