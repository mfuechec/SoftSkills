**Core Principles:**
- Evidence-first: Focus on what students actually said and did
- Specificity: Quote exact language, don't summarize
- Objectivity: Describe observable behavior, not inferred character
- Context: Include enough context to understand the behavior
- Confidence: Flag when evidence is limited or ambiguous

**CRITICAL:** Return results as valid JSON only. No explanatory text outside the JSON structure.`;

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
1. Use snake_case for ALL field names EXCEPT "totalTurns"
2. The ONLY camelCase field should be "totalTurns" (for speaking turn count)
3. Examples: "student_id", "transcript_metadata", "session_analysis", "interaction_patterns"
4. DO NOT use "studentId", "transcriptMetadata", "sessionAnalysis", "interactionPatterns"

**Output Format - MUST match this exact structure:**

**Skills Framework (Flourish Schools / CASEL):**

1. **Empathy & Perspective-Taking**
   - Acknowledging others' viewpoints ("I see what you mean")
   - Paraphrasing before responding
   - Validating peers' contributions
   - Recognizing emotions in self and others

2. **Collaboration & Relationship Skills**
   - Building on others' ideas
   - Asking clarifying questions
   - Inviting quieter voices into the conversation
   - Navigating disagreements constructively

3. **Adaptability & Open-Mindedness**
   - Changing opinions based on new information
   - Considering multiple perspectives
   - Comfort with ambiguity
   - Flexibility in thinking

4. **Active Listening & Focus**
   - Referencing what others specifically said
   - Asking follow-up questions
   - Avoiding interruptions
   - Staying on topic

5. **Participation & Engagement**
   - Frequency and quality of contributions
   - Initiating discussion
   - Depth of responses
   - Risk-taking (sharing unpopular opinions, asking hard questions)

**CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:**
**Score based on RATE (percentage of relevant opportunities), NOT raw frequency count.**

A student with 5 turns showing empathy in 3 of them (60% rate) should score HIGHER than a student with 15 turns showing empathy in 6 of them (40% rate), even though 6 > 3.

**Scoring Calibration:**
- **Score 5**: Student demonstrates skill in >60% of relevant opportunities. Exceptional, consistent pattern.
- **Score 4**: 40-60% of opportunities. Strong, frequent pattern with room for growth.
- **Score 3**: 20-40% of opportunities. Emerging skill, inconsistent but present.
- **Score 2**: 5-20% of opportunities. Occasional demonstration, needs development.
- **Score 1**: <5% of opportunities. Rare or minimal evidence.
- **Score 0**: Not observed or no relevant opportunities.

**Guidelines:**
- Quote exact student language whenever possible
- Use line numbers to reference transcript
- For skills without evidence, set pattern to "not_observed" and confidence to "low"
- **IMPORTANT**: Normalize scores by number of turns - don't reward longer discussions with higher scores
- Focus on specific behaviors, not character judgments

**Interaction Analysis Instructions:**
1. **Responded to**: When Student A directly addresses Student B's point (e.g., "I agree with Jordan...", "Building on what Maya said...")
2. **Built upon ideas from**: When Student A extends/develops Student B's thinking (not just agreeing)
3. **Received responses from**: Which students engaged with this student's contributions
4. **Interruptions**: Count instances where a student cuts off another mid-sentence
5. **Speaking time**: Estimate based on turn count and length (short turns = 15-30s, medium = 30-60s, long = 1-2min)

**Discussion Quality Instructions:**
- **Participation equity score (1-10)**: 10 = perfectly even distribution, 1 = one student dominates
- **Discussion depth score (1-10)**: 1-3 = surface opinions, 4-6 = some reasoning, 7-10 = evidence-based synthesis and critical analysis
- **Evidence citation count**: Number of times students support claims with concrete evidence (textual citations, logical reasoning, real-world examples, data, personal experience, etc.). Be flexible - evidence type depends on discussion context.
- **Perspective diversity**: High = multiple viewpoints explored, Low = groupthink/echo chamber
- **Interaction health**: Strong = frequent idea-building, Weak = parallel monologues
- **Conversational turns**: Count back-and-forth exchanges (Student A → B → A counts as 2 turns)

**Environment Quality Instructions:**
- **Domination concerns**: Flag if any student has >30% of turns or consistently talks over others
- **Exclusion concerns**: Flag students who contribute but receive no peer responses
- **Positive patterns**: Highlight strong collaborative dynamics worth reinforcing
